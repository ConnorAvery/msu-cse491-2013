Homework #6 - the last one!
===========================

Due Wed, May 1st, at midnight.  Office hours on Tuesday Apr 23rd, but
then I'm out of town on Apr 30th; arrange something with Cait if you
want help.

0. See point 0 in :doc:`hw5`, but fill out `this form
   <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Cpa6iyEo146y4vUESmqrM2gmMtzqKHwZE9B-A_ieeIw/viewform>`__
   instead.

1. Implement a WSGI server that speaks POST well enough to handle a JSON-RPC
   request.  Test it on your live Web app. (20/100)

2. Implement your feature from HW #5.2. Give me documentation, somewhere,
   on what it does and how -- hey, maybe it can be on a Web page! (20/100)

3. Change db.py to use SQLite to save/load everything. (20/100)

4. Modify HW 4.2(c) with AJAX/JSON-RPC instead of an HTML form submit. (20/100)

Hand in by tagging as hw6.

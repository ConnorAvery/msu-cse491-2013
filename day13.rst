Web App Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thus far in class, we have laid a foundation for building a web app. We start from text files, turn it into data, collect the data into a database (well, Python data structures currently), allow querying of the database, return query results, and output everything as html files:

    .. image:: files/day13_1.png
        :scale: 75 %

In order to develop the drinkz project, we need to expand on certain levels of this foundation. Paths from here are:
 * Outputting strings or serving files
 * Converting the data structures to a SQL database
 * Using web forms to get data or query the database
 * Including some form of security/authentication
 * Incorporating templating

As we add these functionalities to the drinkz framework, we will see a web app emerge:

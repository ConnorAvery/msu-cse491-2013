Day 18 - Tu, Mar 26th, 2013
===========================

Schedule:

 * Ask homework-related questions.
 * Work on questions from :doc:`day17` and today.
 * Minute cards.

Style sheets and HTML
---------------------

Go to http://www.oswd.org/ and find a design you like; download it,
and unpack it (probably 'unzip' should work).  Look at the index.html
file and reverse engineer the various style sheet and HTML
contributions to the pretty design.

Then, modify cse491-linkz (https://github.com/ctb/cse491-linkz/) to
output files that incorporate the styling of the OSWD design you
downloaded.  Note the latest commit to cse491-linkz...

   https://github.com/ctb/cse491-linkz/commit/f303f182016ae30d7b503645d8e709bf8a1e8362

Ask questions as you have them.

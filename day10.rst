===========================

Rough schedule for today, summary:

 - Python data structures

Python data structures
----------------------

Work individually or in groups to write up code examples in response to
the questions on `form 1 <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/13QUhzqaKhOnlqm-enBu5cpgryk7znrIZE-CktUKWAN4/viewform>`__ and then on `form 2 <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Fgmyc2D0QS4GjXFddYx-J-E_f8obcrfey9MeUUeLT7Q/viewform>`__.

We will go over the answers in class at 3:35, and I will post them
here after class.

Once you're done, go consider :doc:`hw3`.

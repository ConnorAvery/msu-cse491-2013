**Objectives:**

In this course, you will learn how the Web works by writing a Web
server and some Web applications.  More generally, we will discuss
concepts in client-server and peer-to-peer architectures and how all
of this technology works "under the hood" on today's Internet.  Weâ€™ll
also discuss issues and approaches to developing software with an eye
to maintainability, and learn about the practical separation of
concerns in Web application stacks, from browser through server.

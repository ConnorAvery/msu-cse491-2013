==================================
Day 3: Tuesday, January 14th, 2014
==================================

0. For class, read http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2009/10/the-xanadu-dream.html

1. `Quiz <https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1YylEh10oDR0wcEMB7RK7l19yiWVE10U-z60FLivQQoQ/viewform>`__ and discussion.

2. Any homework questions?

   a. What is ChangeLog, and how do I modify it?  Do I use 'git log'? (No;
      just edit it with a text editor.)
   b. How and where should I ask questions? At `the Piazza site. <http://www.piazza.com/>`__

3. Demonstration: git and github; editing online and pull requests.

   (Note: this is how we will be doing code review and HW hand in.
   Also see `GitHub Flow. <http://scottchacon.com/2011/08/31/github-flow.html>`__)

   I will need a volunteer!  Basic mousing skills needed, and bravery
   in the face of the unknown.

   a. Log in to github.
   b. Go to https://github.com/ged-lab/msu-cse491-2013
   c. Click on 'fork'.
   d. Go find the 'blog-posts.txt' file and click on it.
   e. Click on 'edit'.
   f. Add 'Hello, world!' just below the first line of equals
   g. Scroll down and push 'commit'.
   h. Click on 'pull requests' (upper right)
   i. Click on 'set up new pull request'.
   j. ...

4. Blog post discussion and signup; see :doc:`blog-posts`

5. Looking at the `HTTP protocol <http://www.jmarshall.com/easy/http/#structure>`__. 

   Concepts:

    * statelessness: Web browsers send a request, Web servers send a response.
    * permission/authentication-less: by default, the expectation is that you
      can link to any open page; by default, there is no authentication.
    * open: the HTTP protocol is an open standard that can be implemented by
      anyone, on either side -- no licensing, no copyrights, no patents.
    * coupling: how interconnected things are. tightly coupled vs loosely coupled.

6. Code examples! (See :doc:`day2`)

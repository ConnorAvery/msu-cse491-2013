Day 11 -- Tu, Feb 12th, 2013
============================

Rough schedule for today, summary:

 - brief discussion of group work
 - work on HW; ask questions; etc.
 - minute cards

Group work
~~~~~~~~~~

The homeworks are only going to get longer and more difficult.  Wouldn't
it be nice to work on it with others?

For this next homework (and hopefully for the rest), we would like to
encourage you to get together with other people, both in and out of
class.  We expect to see three different kinds of work behavior --

1. Lone wolf.  This individual prefers to not work with others, and
   except for explicit group projects, can do so.

2. Pair programming.  Two individuals working through the homework
   together, but submitting commits separately through github.  If
   only one person is doing the commits, that's fine; just make sure
   to note that you were working in pairs.

3. Group work.  Here, individuals can work independently on the
   projects, and then merge afterwards.  As long as the authors are
   noted properly on the commits (you should see them with 'git log',
   in other words) I encourage this mode of work.  Please, however, do
   the merges by yourself.

Work on the homework
